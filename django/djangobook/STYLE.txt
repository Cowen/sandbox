This is a generic document on proper style for code:

Templates:
- Common templates should go under the folder '$PROJECT_ROOT/templates/includes'
- Required HTML tags (DOCTYPE, <html>, ... ) should never be in common templates

Views:
- Usage of locals() and render_to_response are the norm
    - If performance issues arise, hard-code the result of locals()
